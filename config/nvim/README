With its saner default settings, Neovim gives an opportunity to come up with a
simpler Vim configuration. Besides, the built-in async support encourages trying
a different set of plugins.

So this configuration is not shared with Vim at all.

`init.vim` is the base configuration file (Neovimâ€™s equivalent of .vimrc).
It can load two optional files, `mappings.vim` and `plugins.vim`.

Alternatively, Neovim can be started with the (much simpler) `core.vim` config:
     nvim -u ~/.config/nvim/core.vim
