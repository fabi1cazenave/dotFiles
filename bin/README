Helper scripts: very simple (trivial) scripts that I use mostly as reminders /
quick-help / shortcuts, hence the `echo+eval' in all of them.

They could be replaced by functions in ~/.bash_aliases: this works fine in a
terminal, but real scripts can be launched with Alt+F2/dmenu.

This `bin' directory should be added to your $PATH, obviously. That's the case
by default on Ubuntu distros (~/bin) but I prefer to put it in ~/.local/bin.
