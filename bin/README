Helper scripts â€” very simple (trivial) scripts that I use mostly as reminders /
quick help / shortcuts, hence the echo+eval in all of them.

They could be replaced by functions in ~/.bash_aliases: this works fine in a
terminal, but real scripts can be launched from dmenu (or whatever Alt+F2).

This ~/bin directory should be added to your $PATH, obviously.
